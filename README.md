# Equity-centered-design-with-American-Indians-and-Alaskan-Natives-10x
Creating a framework for Federal agencies to better engage Tribal governments and communities in more equitable consultation and collaboration. 

## 10x project framing 
Phase 1 project Description: Today, 1.9 million American Indians and Alaska Natives belong to 570+ federally recognized tribes. However, tribal consultation (i.e., user research with tribes) is not conducted consistently across federal agencies, or even within individual agencies. This leads to products, services, and policies that don't meet tribes' needs, as well as reporting/administrative burdens disproportionate to the support tribes receive. There is a need for clear, plain language guidance, as well as a standardized platform for engaging tribes in meaningful consultation, which would help create more consistent and equitable engagement with, and better services for, American Indians and Alaska Natives. 10x will explore plain language guidance and other tools to create a more consistent and equitable engagement with American Indians and Alaska Natives.

## Potential impact
Federal agencies are better able to meet their mission, improve nation-to-nation relationships, create better products, and uphold US law when consultation requested from Tribal nations is approached with an equitable framework.
